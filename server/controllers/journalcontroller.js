    // get() is one of the methods in the object, and we call it here. This method allows us to complete an HTTP GET request. We pass two arguments into the .get method.
    // The first argument '/practice' is the path. Similar to how we used the /test path to test out Postman previously.
    // The second argument is an anonymous callback function. This is also sometimes called a “handler function”. This function gets called when the application receives a request to the specified route and HTTP method. The application “listens” for requests that match the specified route(s) and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback function.
    //Inside our callback function, we call res.send() .send() is an express method that can be called on the res or response object. Our response parameter is just a simple string.
    //We inject the validateJWT variable as a middleware function in the '/practice' route. It will check to see if the incoming request has a token for this specific route.
